\subsection*{Features}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This project emulates G\+P\+IB drives and H\+P\+GL printer for the H\+P85A and H\+P85B computers.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Each drive can be fully defined in the hpdisk.\+cfg file on the SD C\+A\+RD
\item A\+M\+I\+GO drives work with H\+P85A
\item S\+S80 drives work with H\+P85B (or H\+P85A with prm-\/85 add on board see links)
\item Printer emulator -\/ can capture and save printer data to a time stamped file.
\item You can connect with and control the emulator via its F\+TI U\+SB serial interface 115200 baud, 8\+N1.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item There are many commands that you can use, type \char`\"{}help for a list\char`\"{}
\item Any key press halts the emulator and waits for a user command.
\item After finishing any user commend it returns to G\+P\+IB disk emulation.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Each emulated disk image is a single file on a F\+A\+T32 formatted S\+D\+C\+A\+RD.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Internally these disk images are formatted using the L\+IF standard.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item L\+IF format used is compatible with H\+P85\+A/B and many other computers
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item L\+IF Tools are built into the emulator to create, rename, delete add and extract to/from other L\+IF images.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item L\+IF tools can also create new L\+IF images with user specifications
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The emulator will automatically create missing L\+IF images defined and named in hpdisk.\+cfg on the S\+D\+C\+A\+RD
\item For the specific L\+IF E010..E013(hex) type images the emulator can translate to and from plain A\+S\+C\+II files.
\item The emulator can add and extract as L\+IF image format
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You may add a single file from another L\+IF image with multiple internal files.
\item You may extract a single file from a L\+IF image to a new L\+IF image.
\item Extracted images have a 256 byte volume header, 256 byte directory followed by a file.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Type \char`\"{}lif help\char`\"{} in the emulator for a full list of commands
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item See the top of \hyperlink{lifutils_8c}{lif/lifutils.\+c} for full documentation and examples. 

 \subsection*{Compiling}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

This code was developed under Ubuntu Linux 14.\+04 and 16.\+04 with avr
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item These packages must be installed\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item avr-\/libc avra avrdude avrdude-\/doc avrp binutils-\/avr gcc-\/avr gdb-\/avr
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item When Compiling you must update the Makefiles
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Comment out the lines
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item G\+I\+T\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+S\+I\+ON \+:= \$(shell stat -\/cx update.\+last 2$>$/dev/null)
\item L\+O\+C\+A\+L\+\_\+\+M\+OD \+:= \$(shell ls -\/rt  $\vert$ tail -\/1 $\vert$ xargs stat -\/cx)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Then find the lines with G\+I\+T\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+S\+I\+ON and L\+O\+C\+A\+L\+\_\+\+M\+OD C\+F\+L\+A\+GS += -\/\+D\+G\+I\+T\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+S\+I\+ON=\char`\"{}my version\char`\"{} C\+F\+L\+A\+GS += -\/\+D\+L\+O\+C\+A\+L\+\_\+\+M\+OD=\char`\"{}todays date\char`\"{} 


\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Using the emulator with provider examples}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item See sdcard.\+cfg for configuration settings and setting and documentation.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Printer capture is configured currently for my H\+P54645D scope
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The following example works for an H\+P85 attached to the emulator via G\+P\+IB bus.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item P\+R\+I\+N\+T\+ER IS 705
\item P\+L\+I\+ST
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Disk images in S\+D\+C\+A\+RD folder drive and configuration settings
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item First S\+S80 H\+P9134L disk at 700 for my H\+P85A (with 85A R\+O\+Ms)
\item First Amigo 9121D disk at 710 for my H\+P85B (with 85B R\+O\+Ms)
\item Second S\+S80 H\+P9134L disk at 720 for my H\+P85A (with 85A R\+O\+Ms)
\item Second Amigo 9121D disk at 730 for my H\+P85B (with 85B R\+O\+Ms)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item How to use the examples with your H\+P85
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Copy the files inside the project S\+D\+C\+A\+RD folder to the home folder of a fat32 formatted drive
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All image files and configuration must be in the home folder only -\/ not in a subdirectory.
\item You may store other user files in sub folders of your choosing.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Verify hpdisk.\+cfg configuration settings for your computer
\item Insert card into emulator
\item Attract G\+P\+IB cables
\item Power on emulator
\item Power on your computer last!
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The emulator M\+U\+ST be running and attached to your computer first!
\item The H\+P85 O\+N\+LY checks for drives at power up. 

 \subsection*{Understanding Drive G\+P\+IB B\+US addressing and Parallel Poll Response (P\+PR) -\/ H\+P85A vs. H\+P85B}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

While G\+P\+IB devices can have address between 0 and 31 you can have no more than 8 disk drives.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A\+LL disk drives are required to respond to a P\+PR query by the (H\+P85) controller.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item P\+PR query is done when the controller in charge (H\+P85) pulls A\+TN and E\+OI low.
\item P\+PR response occurs when a disk drive pulls one G\+P\+IB bus data line low in response.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You can only have 8 of these because there are only 8 G\+P\+IB data bus lines.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item G\+P\+IB data bus bits are numbered from 1 to 8
\item P\+PR response bits are {\itshape assigned in reverse order} starting from 8, bit 8 for device 0
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is a G\+P\+IB specification -\/ not my idea.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The H\+P85 uses these assumptions
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item P\+PR bits are assigned in reverse order from device numbers.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+N\+T! On power up the H\+P85 issues a P\+PR query for disk drives
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The emulator must be running B\+E\+F\+O\+RE this happens.
\item P\+PR query = both A\+TN and E\+OI being pulled low by the computer.
\item P\+PR response is when each drive pulls a single G\+P\+IB data bus bit L\+OW -\/ while A\+TN and E\+OI are low.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape O\+N\+LY} those that are detected in this way are then next scanned
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Next for all detected drives the H\+P85 issues \char`\"{}\+Request Identify\char`\"{} to each in turn.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is done one drive at a time in order
\item The P\+PR keyword in the hpdisk.\+cfg is the P\+PR bit the drive uses
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item P\+PR of 0 = P\+PR response on G\+P\+IB data bus bit number 8 -\/ as per G\+P\+IB B\+US specifications.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The ID keyword in hpdisk.\+cfg is the 16 bit reply to \char`\"{}\+Request Identify Reply\char`\"{}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+N\+T! A\+M\+I\+GO drives cannot be queried for detailed drive layout information
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The H\+P85A can only use its {\itshape hardcoded firmware tables} to map ID to disk layout parameters
\item This implies that the H\+P85A can only use A\+M\+I\+GO disks it has defined in firmware.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The H\+P85B can query newer S\+S80 drives for detailed drive layout information instead.
\item The H\+P85A cannot use S\+S80 drives unless it uses copies of the H\+P85B E\+MS and E\+D\+I\+SK R\+O\+MS.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item One way this can be done with the P\+R\+M-\/85 expansion board offered by Bill Kotaska
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item (The P\+R\+M-\/85 is great product giving you access to all of the useful R\+O\+MS) 

 \subsection*{Limitations}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Multiple U\+N\+IT support is N\+OT yet implemented however multiple drive support is..
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item While most A\+M\+I\+GO and S\+S80 feature have been implemented my primary focus was on the H\+P85A and H\+P85B.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item (I do not have access to other computers to test for full compatibility)
\item This means that a few A\+M\+I\+GO and S\+S80 G\+P\+IB commands are not yet implemented!
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Some of these are extended reporting modes -\/ many of which are optional.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Note\+: The H\+P85A can only use A\+M\+I\+GO drives -\/ unless you have the H\+P85B E\+MS R\+OM installed in your H\+P\+H9A
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This can be done with the P\+R\+M-\/85 expansion board offered by Bill Kotaska (a great product!)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item To attach a drive to our computer, real or otherwise, you must know\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The correct G\+P\+IB B\+US address and parallel pool response (P\+PR) bit number your computer expects.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item See A\+D\+D\+R\+E\+SS, P\+PR and ID values in S\+D\+C\+A\+R\+D/hpdisk.\+cfg
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Older computers may only support A\+M\+I\+GO drives.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Such computers will have a hard coded in firmware list of drive its supports.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item These computers will issue a G\+P\+IB B\+US \char`\"{}request identify\char`\"{} command and only detect those it knows about.
\item {\itshape If these assumptions do N\+OT match the layout defined in the hpdisk.\+cfg no drives will be detected.}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Newer computers with S\+S80 support can request fully detailed disk layout instead of the \char`\"{}request identify\char`\"{}
\item My emulator supports both reporting methods -\/ but your computer may not use them both!
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For supported values consult your computer manuals or corresponding drive manual for your computer.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item See gpib/drives\+\_\+parameters.\+txt for a list on some known value (C\+R\+E\+D\+I\+TS; these are from the H\+P\+Dir project)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item In all cases the hpdisk.\+cfg parameters M\+U\+ST match these expectations.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The hpdisk.\+cfg file tells the emulator how the emulated disk is defined.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item G\+P\+IB B\+US address, Parallel Poll Response bit number and A\+M\+I\+GO Request Identify response values.
\item Additional detail for S\+S80 drives that newer computers can use.
\item In A\+LL cases the file informs the code what parameters to emulate and report.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A\+LL of these values M\+U\+ST match your computers expectations for drives it knows about.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Debugging
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You can enable reporting of all unimplemented G\+P\+IB commands (see {\itshape T\+O\+DO} debug option in hpdisk.\+cfg)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Useful if you are trying this on a non H\+P85 device
\item See the S\+D\+C\+A\+R\+D/hpdisk.\+cfg for documentation on the full list of debugging options
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The emulator can passively log all transactions between real hardware on the G\+P\+IB bus
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use the \char`\"{}gpib trace $\ast$logfile$\ast$\char`\"{} command -\/ pressing any key exits -\/ no emulation is done in this mode.
\item You can use this to help understand what is sent to and from you real disks.
\item I use this feature to help prioritize which commands I first implemented.

{\bfseries  {\bfseries Anders Gustafsson was extremely helpful in providing me his current code and details of his project -\/ which I am very thankful for.}}

{\bfseries  As mainly a personal exercise in fully understanding the code I ended up rewriting much of the hpdisk project. I did this one part at a time as I learned the protocols and specifications -\/ N\+OT because of any problems with his original work.}

{\bfseries  Although mostly rewritten I have maintained the basic concept of using state machines for G\+P\+IB read and write functions as well as for S\+S80 execute state tracking.}

{\bfseries Notes\+: When both E\+OI and A\+TN are low the H\+C32 enables H\+C595 outputs
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If any H\+C595 output is high the G\+P\+IB bus bit will be pulled low
\item I\+FC low resets the H\+C595 outputs low -\/ so the H\+C05 outputs will float.
